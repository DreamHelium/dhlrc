# Development Document

If you are not a developer, you can ignore this directory.

This is mainly for the `region_module` part (currently `region-nbt-rs` and `region-litematic-rs`).

You need to compile your library as a **dynamic** library (`.so/.dll/.dylib`), then we can use the dynamic loading to
load the library.
